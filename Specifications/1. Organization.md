# 1. Organization
Actual code organization in Phi is a lot similar to Verilog, but the syntax is closer to C++, TypeScript and Swift.

Hardware is laid out in modules, for example. In Verilog, a counter may look like this:

```verilog
module Counter(
    input clock,
    input reset,
    input increment,
    output[31:0] out
);

reg [31:0] counter;

always @ (posedge clock or negedge reset) begin
    if (!rst) begin
        counter <= 32'b0;
    end else begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end
end

endmodule
```


In Phi, it looks markedly similar, just with a different syntax:

```phi
module Counter(
    clock: Clock,
    reset: Reset<Async, Low>,
    increment: Input,
    output: Output[31:0]
) {
    Register[31:0] counter = 32b0;

    when clock.posedge {
        counter.next = counter + 1
    }
}
```
