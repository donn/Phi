## Modules
Module in Phi are semantically a lot similar to Verilog, but the syntax is closer to C++, TypeScript and Swift.

As an example, in Verilog, a counter may look like this:

```verilog
module Counter(
    input clock,
    input reset,
    output[31:0] out
);

reg[31:0] counter;

always @ (posedge clock or negedge reset) begin
    if (!rst) begin
        counter <= 32'b0;
    end else begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end
end

assign out = counter;

endmodule
```

In Phi, it looks very similar, just with a different syntax:

```phi
module Counter(
    clock: @clock Input,
    reset: @resetLow Input,
    output: Output[31..0]
) {
    Register[31..0] store = 32b0;
    
    store.data = store + 1;

    out = store;
}
```
