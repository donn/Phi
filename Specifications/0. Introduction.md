## A note on the predecessor
The Verilog Hardware Description Language is a register-transfer level (RTL) hardware description language that allows for the modeling of hardware both structurally and behaviorally, in procedural or continuous fashion.

Unfortunately, Verilog is deeply flawed. The fundamental issue being that it is very ambiguous by default.

In software, perhaps this ambiguity can make things a little faster- and even then software communities have lately begun to move to languages with a little bit more safety. But for hardware description, there really should be no such ambiguity.

## Phi
Phi is a hardware description language with distinct metadefinition and definition constructs. A safe langauge where metadefinition constructs are strongly-typed and  defintion constructs treats buses as the bits they are.
