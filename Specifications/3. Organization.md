# 3. Organization
All files in Phi are UTF-8, and they must end with the extension `.phi`.
 
## 3.1 The top level
At the top level, only *namespaces*, *modules* and *interfaces* can be declared.

A **namespace** is a compile-time only semantic provision. Instead of polluting the top level namespace, one might elect to declare a namespace and place their module under it.

A namespace can be any valid Phi identifier, excluding `Phi`, which is reserved for use by the language.

An example is covered under **Interfaces** below.

### 3.1.1 Modules
Like in other popular HDLs, a module is a design unit with specified inputs and outputs that performs a specific function based on its design.

A counter for example would be a module. 

```phi
module Counter<width=32>(
    clock: @clock Input,
    reset: @reset Input,
    output: Output[31..0]
) {
    Register[(width - 32d1)..0] store = [width[[1b0]]]
    
    store.data = store + 1

    out = store
}
```
***Snippet 0: A typical Phi module; in this case, a counter with a customizable width***

A module consists of a port list (see Section 3.1.1.1), a parameter list (see Section 3.1.1.2), and a body (see Section 4).

Modules can instantiate other modules and use their functionality as such:

```
module ClockDivider(input: Input, reset: Input, output: Output, cycleCount: Output[31..0]) {
    namespace Dividing {
        Wire[31..0] counterOutput

        Counter counter(
            clock: input,
            reset: reset,
            output: counterOutput
        )
    }

    Wire[31..0] counterOutput

    Counter counter(clock: Dividing.counterOutput[1], reset: reset, output: counterOutput)

    output = Dividing.counterOutput[1]
    cycleCount = counterOutput
}
```
***Snippet 1: A module utilizing internal namespaces and submodules***

As demoed, a namespace could also be declared inside a module. This allows grouping of internal declarations.

A module may not instantiate itself, nor any other module that would eventually instantiate itself.

Declarations and statements inside modules are documented in the next section.

#### 3.1.1.1 Ports
A port is a special kind of **Wire** that is exposed from the module to other modules.

It can be either an `Input` or an `Output`.

Input ports may be ignored, but all Output ports declared must be driven.

#### 3.1.1.2 Parameters
Likewise, a parameter is a special kind of **Var** that is exposed from the module to other modules. They can be assigned a default value. All parameters are 32-bit software expressions.

### 3.1.2 Interfaces and Compliance
An interface is a set of ports and parameters a module may choose to comply with.

As an example, when designing an SoC for a specific bus, typically any module has to have a specific set of ports (and in rarer cases, parameters).

```phi
namespace AHBLite {
    interface Slave<dataWidth=32>(
        HCLK: @clock Input,
        HRESETn: @reset Input,

        HSEL: Input,
        HTRANS: Input[1..0],
        HADDR: Input[31..0],
        HWDATA: Input[(dataWidth - 32d1)..0],
        HSIZE: Input[2..0],
        HBURST: Input[2..0],
        HPROT: Input[3..0],

        HMASTLOCK: Input,
        HWRITE: Input,
        HREADY: Input,

        HRESP: Output,
        HREADYOUT: Output,
        HRDATA: Output[(dataWidth - 32d1)..0]
    )
} 
```
***Snippet 2: An interface***

Designing a module that complies with this is very simple:

```phi
namespace Example {
    module IO(output: Output): AHBLite.Slave {
        Register last_HSEL = 1b0;
        Register last_HWRITE = 1b0;
        Register last_HTRANS = 1b0;

        last_HSEL.data = HREADY ? HSEL : last_HSEL;
        last_HWRITE.data = HREADY ? HWRITE : last_HWRITE;
        last_HWTRANS.data = HREADY ? HTRANS : last_HTRANS;

        Register[(dataWidth-1)..0] storage = [dataWidth-1[[1b0]]];
        storage.data = mux last_HSEL & last_HWRITE & last_HTRANS {
            1b0: storage,
            1b1: HWDATA
        };
        
        HRDATA = storage;
        HREADYOUT = 1b1;
        HRESP = 1b0;
    }
}
```
***Snippet 3: A module complying with an interface***

Interfaces may comply with other interfaces. An interface may not comply with itself or an interface that would transitively comply with itself.

A module can comply with one or more interfaces, and add ports of its own (so long as they do not neglect output ports they have complied to.) Modules can comply with the same interface as many times as possible, including transitively. A module may not, however, comply with multiple interfaces that utilize the same port name with conflicting definitions. A conflicting definition

```phi
interface Alpha(a: Input)

interface Beta(b: Output): Alpha

interface Gamma(c: Output): Alpha, Alpha // Second Alpha is ignored

interface Delta(a: Output)

interface Epsilon(a: Input[1..0])

module Zeta(): Beta, Gamma { b = ~a; c = a } //  Expands to Beta, Alpha, Gamma, Alpha, Alpha: the second and third alphas are simply ignored.

module Eta(c: Output): Alpha, Delta // INVALID: a is Input in Alpha, Output in Delta. 

module Theta(c: Output): Alpha, Epsilon // INVALID: a is Input in Alpha, Input[1..0] in Delta. 
```
***Snippet 4: A more complex interface compliance scheme***

## 3.2 In comparison to Verilog
Modules in Phi are semantically a lot similar to Verilog, but the syntax is closer to Swift.

As an example, in Verilog, the counter example above would be analagous to this:

```verilog
module Counter(
    input clock,
    input reset,
    output Register[31:0] out
);

always @ (posedge clock or negedge reset) begin
    if (!rst) begin
        out <= 32'b0;
    end else begin
        out <= counter + 1;
    end
end

endmodule
```

Interfaces and namespaces are not available in Verilog.
