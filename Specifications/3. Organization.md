# 3. Organization
All files in Phi are UTF-8, and they must end with the extension .phi.
 
## 3.1 The top level
At the top level, only *namespaces*, *modules* and *interfaces* can be declared.

A **namespace** is a compile-time only semantic provision. Instead of polluting the top level namespace, one might elect to declare a namespace and place their module under it. An example is covered under **Interfaces** below.

### 3.1.1 Modules
Like in other popular HDLs, a module is a design unit with specified inputs and outputs that performs a specific function based on its design.

A counter for example would be a module. 

```phi
module Counter<width=(32d32)>(
    clock: @clock Input,
    reset: @resetLow Input,
    output: Output[31..0]
) {
    Register[(width - 32d1)..0] store = [width[[1b0]]];
    
    store.data = store + 1;

    out = store;
}
```

Modules can instantiate other modules and use their functionality as such:

```
module ClockDivider(input: Input, reset: Input, output: Output, cycleCount: Output[31..0]) {
    namespace Dividing {
        Wire[31..0] counterOutput;

        Counter counter(
            clock: input,
            reset: reset,
            output: counterOutput
        );
    }

    Wire[31..0] counterOutput;

    Counter counter(clock: Dividing.counterOutput[1], reset: reset, output: counterOutput);

    output = Dividing.counterOutput[1];
    cycleCount = counterOutput;
}
```

As demoed, a namespace could also be declared inside a module. This allows grouping of internal declarations.

Declarations and statements inside modules are documented in the next section.

#### 3.1.1.1 Ports
A port is a special kind of **Wire** that is exposed from the module to other modules.

It can be either an `Input` or an `Output`.

Input ports may be ignored altogether, but all Output ports declared must be driven.

#### 3.1.1.2 Parameters
Likewise, a parameter is a special kind of **Var** that is exposed from the module to other modules. They can be assigned a default value.

### 3.1.2 Interfaces and Compliance
An interface is a set of ports and parameters a module may choose to comply with. A module can comply with one or more interfaces, and add ports of its own (so long as they do not neglect output ports they have complied to.)

As an example, when designing an SoC for a specific bus, typically any module has to have a specific set of ports (and in rarer cases, parameters).

```phi
namespace AHBLite {
    interface Slave<dataWidth=(32d32)>(
        HCLK: @clock Input,
        HRESETn: @resetLow Input,

        HSEL: Input,
        HTRANS: Input[1..0],
        HADDR: Input[31..0],
        HWDATA: Input[(dataWidth - 32d1)..0],
        HSIZE: Input[2..0],
        HBURST: Input[2..0],
        HPROT: Input[3..0],

        HMASTLOCK: Input,
        HWRITE: Input,
        HREADY: Input,

        HRESP: Output,
        HREADYOUT: Output,
        HRDATA: Output[(dataWidth - 32d1)..0]
    );
} 
```

Designing a module that complies with this is very simple:

```phi
namespace Example {
    module IO: AHBLite.Slave (output: Output) {
        Register last_HSEL = 1b0;
        Register last_HWRITE = 1b0;
        Register last_HTRANS = 1b0;

        last_HSEL.data = HREADY ? HSEL : last_HSEL;
        last_HWRITE.data = HREADY ? HWRITE : last_HWRITE;
        last_HWTRANS.data = HREADY ? HTRANS : last_HTRANS;

        Register[(dataWidth-1)..0] storage = [dataWidth-1[[1b0]]];
        storage.data = mux last_HSEL & last_HWRITE & last_HTRANS {
            1b0: storage,
            1b1: HWDATA
        };
        
        HRDATA = storage;
        HREADYOUT = 1b1;
        HRESP = 1b0;
    }
}
```

## 3.2 In comparison to Verilog
Modules in Phi are semantically a lot similar to Verilog, but the syntax is closer to Swift.

As an example, in Verilog, the counter example above would be  analagous to this:

```verilog
module Counter(
    input clock,
    input reset,
    output Register[31:0] out
);

always @ (posedge clock or negedge reset) begin
    if (!rst) begin
        out <= 32'b0;
    end else begin
        out <= counter + 1;
    end
end

endmodule
```

Interfaces and namespaces are not available in Verilog.
