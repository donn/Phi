# 1. Variables
Variables in Phi are software-only constructs that are only processed at compile-time.

Variables can be coupled with an array subscript, i.e. `Wire[31..0]`, to declare an Integer. Integers may be up to 65536 bits long.

Variables can be assigned to anywhere in the body of a module that is not an `async` block. Async blocks will be documented later.

## Operations

### $
* Type: Special
* Operand: Many bus expressions of variable widths
* Result: One X-bit bus expression

Invocation of a system call as shall be detailed later in the language. The result depends on the system call.

### +
* Type: Binary
* Operands: Two X-bit bus expressions
* Result: (X+1)-bit bus expression

Performs integer addition on the two buses. The carry bit is appended to become the most significant bit.

### &+
* Type: Binary
* Operands: Two X-bit bus expressions
* Result: X-bit bus expression

Performs integer addition on the two buses. The carry bit is discarded.
