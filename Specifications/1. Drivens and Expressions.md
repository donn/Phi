# 1.1 Drivens
Drivens are the base primitives of the Phi Hardware Description Language. They are all **bit-vectors** that are used to represent storage of compile-time or run time data.

## 1.1.1 Variables
Variables in Phi are software-only constructs that are processed at compile-time.

Variables can be coupled with a bus declaration, i.e. `Var[31..0]`, to declare a variable. They may be from 1 to 65536 bits long.

A bus delaration consists of `[`, a range **or** a software variable and `]`. Ranges are detailed in Section 4.1.1.

Variables support a lot of operations, and all these operations have values that are known at compile time that are known as **software expressions**. As such, all constants, including **fixed-width, explicit-base** numeric are considered to be software expressions.

FWEB numbers are numbers with three components: **width**, **base** and **value**. For example, `32xABC` is a 32-bit hexadecimal number with value ABC. The width is always supplied as a **decimal** value from **0** through **65535**.

Standalone numbers (i.e., `0`, `2141`) are also software expressions, but their width is always 32-bit and they are always decimals. Their use in complex expressions is expressly discouraged.

Variables can be assigned to anywhere in the body of a module that is not a `comb` block. Assignments and comb blocks will be documented later.

```phi
    Var[15..0] variable
```
***Snippet 0: Example declaration of a variable***

## 1.1.2 Wires
Wires in Phi represent logical connections in hardware.

Like variables, wires can be coupled with a bus declaration, i.e. `Wire[31..0]`, to declare a hardware bus.

Buses support most of the same operations performed on variables with the exception of system calls (1.3.3.1).

The results of bus operations are called hardware expressions. **All software expressions are hardware expressions, but the converse is not true.** This is because while all "compile-time" values are known at "run-time", the opposite is obviously not true.

```phi
    Wire[15..0] variable;
```
***Snippet 1: Example declaration of a wire***

### 1.1.3.2 Driving
A **driver** determines the value of a driven. A driver is either:
* An assignment using the `=` operator at the top level of a module
* An `comb` block in which this wire is assigned (detailed in Section 4)

The same variable or wire cannot have more than one driver.

```phi
    variable = 16d9090;
    Wire[15..0] otherVariable = variable &+ 32b1010;
```
***Snippet 2: Examples for driving a wire***

# 1.3 Expressions
Any bitvector value in Phi is considered an expression. This includes any driven or literal, and the results of operating upon them. Operators are detailed below.

## 1.3.1 Left Hand Expressions
A special set of expressions in Phi are known as left hand expressions. Left hand expressions are expressions, but the reverse is not true. These expressions are used to resolve and identify drivens and modules within Phi's symbol table: the entire left hand expression represents **one** value.

### 1.3.1.1 Left Hand Operators
These operators work only within left hand expressions.

---
#### 1.3.1.1.1 .
* Type: Binary
* Operand: Two LHExpressions

Used to access a property of a namespace or a container.

#### 1.3.1.1.2 []
* Type: Binary
* Operand: One LHExpression, one software expression

Used to access either a certain bit of a driven or a particular driven in an array of drivens.

#### 1.3.1.1.3 [..]
* Type: Binary
* Operand: One LHExpression, two software expressions as a Range

Used to access a range of bits of a driven. The order must be the same as the declaration of the driven, i.e., a driven declared with order `[4..0]` cannot be accessed with the range `[1..3]`.

## 1.3.2 Operators
Operations in Phi are strict about bus widths: namely, if operations have mismatched or otherwise incompatible width, the compiler shall return a semantic error.

There are two kinds of operators in Phi, binary and unary. The binary ones have the syntax `left op right` and the unary ones have the syntax `op operand`.

Based on the value of operand0, the expression takes on the value of one of operand1 thorugh operand(N) where N is 2^Y.

A special kind of literal called a **don't care fixed-width numeric** is allowed here. These are fixed width binary, octal or hexadecimal numerics with an `?` in place of a digit, meaning the value of this digit can be ignored.
