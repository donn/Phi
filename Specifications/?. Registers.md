# ?. Registers
Registers in Phi have special properties that are more structural in approach than Verilog.

As the @ blocks have been eliminated, Register clocking and reset signals are now done manually under the assumption that the abstraction is not desirable.

## Clocking
```phi
    Register register;
    register.clock = clock;
    register.next  = register &+ 32b1;
```

This declares a one bit register clocked with `clock`. When clock is at the positive edge, the register's value becomes whatever is assigned to the wire `register.next`: in this case, in this case it would be the value of the register added to 1.

To replicate behavior from Verilog's clock triggered procedural blocks, an `async` block can be used:

```phi
    async {
        if someArbitraryCondition {
            register.next = register &+ 32b1;
        }
    }
```

## Resetting
### Synchronous
Synchronous resets are straightforward:

```phi
    register.next = reset ? register &+ 32b1 : 32b0;
```

### Asynchronous
Asynchronous resets are slightly more verbose.

```phi
    register.reset = reset; // High
    register.reset = ~reset; // Low
```

Registers take their initial assigned value when reset asynchronously, i.e. you would have to assign the register a value at some point in the code.

Here are some valid options:

```phi
    Register register = 1b0;
    register.reset = reset;
```

```phi
    Register register;
    register.reset = reset;

    register = 1b0;
```

## Shorthand Annotations
In port declarations, you can quickly specify which ports are supposed to be clocks and resets as typically, clocking every single register can be a chore.

```phi
module Counter(
    clock: @clock Input,
    reset: @resetLow Input,
    output: Output[31..0]
) 
```

This will set it so all registers declared within counter automatically have their clock signal set to `clock` and their reset signal set to `~reset`.

There are three such annotations: `clock`, `resetHigh` and `resetLow`.
