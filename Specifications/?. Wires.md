# ?. Wires
Wires in Phi represent logical connections in hardware.

Like variables, wires can be coupled with an array subscript, i.e. `Wire[31..0]`, to declare a Bus. Buses are treated as variable length integers throughout the entirety of Phi.

Buses may be up to 65536 bits long.

Buses support *all* the same operations performed on variables with the exception of system calls. Unlike variables, Wire values are only unknown at run time.

The results of bus operations are called bus expressions. **All variable expressions are bus expressions, but the converse is not true.**

## Driving
A **driver** determines the value of the wire. A driver is either:
* A top level assignment using the `=` operator
* An `async` block in which this wire is assigned (detailed in Section X)

The same wire cannot have more than one driver.

## Operations
Operations in Phi are strict about bus widths: namely, if operations have mismatched or otherwise incompatible width, the compiler shall return a semantic error.
