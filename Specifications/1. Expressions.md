# 1. Expressions
## 1.1 Variables
Variables in Phi are software-only constructs that are processed at compile-time.

Variables can be coupled with a bus declaration, i.e. `Var[31..0]`, to declare a variable. They may be from 1 to 65536 bits long.

A bus delaration consists of `[`, a range **or** a software variable and `]`. Ranges are detailed in Section 4.1.1.

Variables support a lot of operations, and all these operations have values that are known at compile time that are known as **software expressions**. As such, all constants, including **fixed-width, explicit-base** numeric are considered to be software expressions.

FWEB numbers are numbers with three components: **width**, **base** and **value**. For example, `32xABC` is a 32-bit hexadecimal number with value ABC. The width is always supplied as a **decimal** value from **0** through **65536**.

Standalone numbers (i.e., `0`, `2141`) are also software expressions, but their width is always 32-bit and they are always decimals. Their use in complex expressions is expressly discouraged.

Variables can be assigned to anywhere in the body of a module that is not an `comb` block. Assignments and comb blocks will be documented later.

```phi
    Var[15..0] variable;
```

## 1.2 Wires
Wires in Phi represent logical connections in hardware.

Like variables, wires can be coupled with a bus declaration, i.e. `Wire[31..0]`, to declare a hardware bus.

Buses support most of the same operations performed on variables with the exception of system calls (1.4.1).

The rationale of not making system calls available is obvious, but for the latter three hardware generated for these is too complex, making the abstraction undesirable. A standard library of components will offer functionality for multiplication, division and modulo through the use of hardware modules.

The results of bus operations are called hardware expressions. **All software expressions are hardware expressions, but the converse is not true.** This is because while all "compile-time" values are known at "run-time", the opposite is obviously not true.

```phi
    Wire[15..0] variable;
```
***Snippet 1: Example declaration of a wire***

### 1.2.1 Driving
A **driver** determines the value of the wire. A driver is either:
* An assignment using the `=` operator at the top level of a module
* An `comb` block in which this wire is assigned (detailed in Section 4)

The same wire cannot have more than one driver.

```phi
    variable = 16d9090;
    Wire[15..0] otherVariable = variable &+ 32b1010;
```
***Snippet 2: Examples for driving a wire***


## 1.3 Operations
Operations in Phi are strict about bus widths: namely, if operations have mismatched or otherwise incompatible width, the compiler shall return a semantic error.

There are two kinds of operators in Phi, binary and unary. The binary ones have the syntax `left op right` and the unary ones have the syntax `op operand`.

    3b001: operand2,
    // ...

)
```
***Snippet 3: mux expression***

Based on the value of operand0, the expression takes on the value of one of operand1 thorugh operand(N) where N is 2^Y.

A special kind of literal called a **don't care fixed-width numeric** is allowed here. These are fixed width binary, octal or hexadecimal numerics with an `?` in place of a digit, meaning the value of this digit can be ignored.
